# Countdown Timer

This is a simple Python-based countdown timer that takes user input for the number of seconds and counts down to zero, displaying the time remaining in `MM:SS` format.

## Features:
- Accepts user input for the countdown time in seconds.
- Displays the countdown in `MM:SS` format.
- Alerts the user when the countdown reaches zero with a "Time's up!" message.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.


## Example:

```
Enter the time in seconds for the countdown: 120
Starting countdown for 120 seconds...
02:00
01:59
01:58
...
00:00
Time's up!
```

## How It Works:
- The program uses Python's `time.sleep()` to pause for 1 second between each countdown update.
- It calculates minutes and seconds from the total seconds using `divmod()`.
- The countdown is displayed in `MM:SS` format and updates every second until the time reaches zero.
